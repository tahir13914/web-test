          Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the <meta> element.

          <h2>  &lt; meta charset="utf-8" &gt; </h2>
          <p> 
          This element specifies the document's character encoding — the character set that the document is permitted to use. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes pretty much any character from any human language. This means that your web page will be able to handle displaying any language; it's therefore a good idea to set this on every web page you create! For example, your page could handle English and Japanese just fine:
          </p>
        </article>

      <aside> 
      --  "  Note: Some browsers (like Chrome)    automatically fix incorrect encodings, so depending on what browser you use, you may not see this problem. You should still set an encoding of utf-8 on your page anyway to avoid any potential problems in other browsers.  ". --
